Payday loans generally charge a percentage or dollar amount per $100 borrowed.

The amount of this fee might range from $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed, depending on your state law and the maximum amount your state permits you to borrow. A fee of $15 per $100 is common. This equates to an annual percentage rate of almost 400% for a two-week loan. So, for example, if you need to borrow $300 before your next payday, it would cost you $345 to pay it back, assuming a fee of $15 per $100.
