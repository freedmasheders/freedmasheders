If you are unable to pay when your loan is due and your state law permits rollovers, the payday lender may allow you to pay only the fees due and then the lender extends the due date of your loan. You will then be charged another fee and still owe the entire original balance. Using the above example, if you pay a renewal or rollover fee of $45 you would still owe the original $300 loan and another $45 fee when the extension is over. Thatâ€™s a $90 charge for borrowing $300 for just four weeks.
